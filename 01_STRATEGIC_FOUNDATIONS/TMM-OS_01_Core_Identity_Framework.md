### 1.0 Positioning Statement
Thapelo Madiba Masebe is a South African transdisciplinary artist, researcher, and emerging data scientist. His practice operates at the intersection of data, memory, and identity, architecting systems to translate the unseen—abstract data, complex emotions, and obscured histories—into tangible, multi-sensory forms.

### 2.0 Artist Statement
Art is a language of memory, loss, time, and identity—a fluid space where personal history and collective experience intersect. My practice is rooted in a transdisciplinary approach, moving across photography, painting, data visualization, multimedia, performance, and conceptual art. Each medium becomes a vessel for storytelling; a means to archive, challenge, and expand the narrative of African existence beyond the limitations imposed by history.

My work charts an emotional and intellectual geography that stretches from my origins in **Seshego, Limpopo**, to my current practice in **Roodepoort, Johannesburg**. This journey from a place of foundational, ancestral memory to a complex urban present informs every piece I create. As an artist and researcher, I engage deeply with themes of ancestry, migration, and the evolving identity of African bodies within a globalized world.

I explore how time distorts and reshapes memory, particularly through the appropriation and reinterpretation of images. My photography acts as an archive of life, capturing fleeting moments that speak to the impermanence of existence. This is where I use **light, color, and composition to create impactful imagery**. My abstract paintings manifest the unseen—the thoughts, emotions, and meditations that exist beyond language but can be felt through form and color. Here, my principle is that **"code is my brush, data is my paint,"** using systematic and generative processes to give form to the abstract.

Collaboration and experimentation are central to my practice, allowing me to investigate the lived experiences of African people. I am deeply invested in sculptural work and writing, reflecting on my roots and how objects, traditions, and landscapes inform identity. The history of my land, the weight of globalization, and the presence of heat—both literal and metaphorical—are integral to my reflections on being. This is my exploration of **the universe, one dataset and one painting at a time.**

At its core, my work is about communication—opening up a dialogue that makes art accessible, personal, and universal. Through love, life, and relationships, I seek to create moments of stillness and connection, reminding us to look closely at the world we inhabit and the histories we carry within us.

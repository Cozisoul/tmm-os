### 1.0 Introduction

This document maps the constellation of thinkers, artists, and designers who inform the TMM-OS. It is not a simple list of "likes" but a structured map of the intellectual and creative lineage from which this practice emerges. The influences are categorized by their primary contribution to the practice, from the core philosophical "why" to the specific operational "how."

### 2.0 Category 1: Philosophical Anchors

*These figures provide the core political, social, and existential conscience of the practice.*

*   **Steve Biko:** The foundational anchor for the philosophy of **Black Consciousness**, self-determination, and the psychological liberation that precedes physical liberation. His systematic thinking informs the entire archival impulse of the practice.
*   **Chris Hani:** Provides the framework for understanding the mechanics of **structural change**, liberation thought, and the necessary connection between intellectual theory and grassroots action.
*   **Carrie Mae Weems:** The master of **re-interrogating historical archives** to comment on contemporary identity. Her method provides the spiritual license and critical framework for projects like `The Biko Archives`.
*   **Zanele Muholi:** The key South African reference for the power of **archival portraiture** as an act of affirmation, documentation, and creating presence for marginalized communities.
*   **William Kentridge:** The South African master of using drawing, animation, and projection as a tool for **excavating and layering personal and political memory**.

### 3.0 Category 2: Methodological Guides

*These figures provide specific strategies, aesthetics, and operational models for creative production.*

*   **Virgil Abloh:** The architect of **systematic minimalism** and the **"3% Rule."** His approach to branding, collaboration, and creating cultural shortcuts is the primary operational guide for the entire brand ecosystem.
*   **Theaster Gates:** The model for **community regeneration through art** and the alchemical transformation of discarded objects into valuable cultural artifacts. Provides the direct methodological blueprint for the `Love Me Again` brand.
*   **Arthur Jafa:** The guide for using powerful **audio-visual collage** and affective sequencing to create layered, critical narratives about Black experience. The primary influence for the visual evolution of `Research Radio`.
*   **Yinka Shonibare, MBE:** The guide for using **material culture** (textiles, objects) as a medium to explore complex post-colonial histories and hybridized identities.
*   **Moshekwa Langa:** The model for **mapping personal journeys** and using found materials to explore the poetics of memory and place, directly influencing the Seshego -> Roodepoort narrative.
*   **Dieter Rams & The Bauhaus:** Represent a foundational belief in **functional, timeless design** and the integration of art, craft, and technology ("Good Design").

### 4.0 Category 3: The Transdisciplinary Studio Model

*These figures, drawn from the Art Salon discussion, provide the direct model for a modern, flexible, and professional creative practice.*

| Influence | Core Concept | Practical Application in My Work |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Konstantin Grcic** | **The Office, not the Studio** | Adopting a professional, systematic, and structured approach to creative work. Emphasizes routine and process, and validates the TMM-OS itself as a core tool. |
| **Martin Boyce** | **The Poetic & The Pragmatic** | Embracing a flexible production model where the studio/office is for thinking and prototyping, while fabrication is strategically outsourced to specialists. |
| **Alex Coles** | **Embedded Research** | Provides the formal academic term for my own process: becoming a "participant observer" in my subject matter, whether it's astronomical data or oral histories. |

### 5.0 Category 4: Operational Contemporaries (The Peers)

*These are active practitioners whose work exists in direct, dynamic dialogue with the practice, defining the contemporary landscape.*

*   **Data, Systems & AI Art:** Refik Anadol, Ryoji Ikeda, Trevor Paglen, Sougwen Chung, Holly Herndon.
*   **Critical Digital & Media Art:** Hito Steyerl, Forensic Architecture, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, CÃ©cile B. Evans, Ian Cheng, Agnieszka Kurant, Simon Denny, Jenna Sutela.
*   **Immersive Experience & Transdisciplinary Design:** Studio Olafur Eliasson, Es Devlin, teamLab, Neri Oxman, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Random International.
*   **Object, Form & Material Innovation:** Samuel Ross, Thomas Heatherwick, Pastoe Meubelen.
*   **Contemporary South African Practice:** Dineo Seshee Bopape, Neo Matloga, Igshaan Adams, Nicholas Hlobo.
*   **Contemporary Photography & Image-Making:** Tyler Mitchell.
*   **Systematic Fashion & Brand Building:** Heron Preston.

### 1.0 Brand Unification Mandate

A primary strategic goal is to unify the two strong but distinct visual identities present in the existing portfolio (warm, serif-based) and the initial brand guidelines (cool, Helvetica-based). The unified system will be the **Systematic-Poetic** approach: the structural clarity of Helvetica for all core typography, softened by the "Cosmic Latte" base color and enlivened by the vibrant, primary accent colors. This creates a bridge between the analytical data scientist and the expressive visual artist.

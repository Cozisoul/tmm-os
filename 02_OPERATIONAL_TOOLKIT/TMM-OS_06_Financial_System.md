### **Part 1: The 15-Year Financial Master Plan**

#### **1.1 Prime Directive: Financial Mastery**
*   **Vision:** To achieve a state of financial independence where creative and institutional projects can be self-funded, and where active philanthropy is a core, sustainable component of the practice.
*   **Net Worth Target (2040):** £5,000,000 - £10,000,000+ (or ZAR equivalent).

#### **1.2 Phased Strategy & Capital Allocation**
*   **Phase 1 (2025-2029): Stability & Seed Capital.**
    *   **Focus:** Maximize income from primary employment. Minimize debt. Build an emergency fund (6 months of living expenses). Make first art/design sales to establish market value and proof of concept.
    *   **Capital Allocation:** 80% Low-Risk Investments (e.g., savings, money market), 20% Learning & Tools (e.g., courses, software, initial project materials).
*   **Phase 2 (2030-2033): Acceleration & Asset Acquisition.**
    *   **Focus:** Leverage increased corporate salary and significant art sales from high-profile collaborations. Begin strategic acquisition of assets (e.g., property, equity).
    *   **Capital Allocation:** 60% Growth Investments (e.g., global stock market ETFs), 30% Real Estate (down payment for the future Studio Masebe), 10% High-Risk/High-Reward (e.g., angel investing in creative startups).
*   **Phase 3 (2034-2040+): Self-Sufficiency & Philanthropy.**
    *   **Focus:** Transition to a model where income from investments and the studio ecosystem surpasses salaried income, making corporate work a choice, not a necessity.
    *   **Capital Allocation:** Establish a formal trust or foundation to manage and deploy philanthropic capital. Fund legacy institutions directly from investment returns.

#### **1.3 Income Stream Architecture**
1.  **Primary Employment:** Salary & bonuses (Data Scientist -> Creative Director).
2.  **Fine Art Sales (`aes72studio`):** High-value original works and limited edition prints.
3.  **Design & Object Sales (`Love Me Again`, `TMHH`):** Commercial sales of furniture and objects.
4.  **Licensing & Collaborations:** Fees from brand partnerships (e.g., `SYSTEM` Capsule) and image licensing.
5.  **Digital Products (`Thapelo Studio Shop`):** Revenue from zines, digital assets, educational content.
6.  **Investment Portfolio Returns:** Dividends and capital gains from a managed investment portfolio.

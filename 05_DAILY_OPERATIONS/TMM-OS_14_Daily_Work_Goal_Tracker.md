### 1.0 Introduction

### 2.0 The Rhythmic Cycle Framework
My work operates on a 3-day rhythmic cycle to balance different modes of thinking and prevent burnout. The `Dashboard` will display the current day's directive. My daily planning should align with this directive.

*   **Day 1: Input (Research & Consumption)**
    *   **Mission:** To learn. Read, listen, gather new information. Fill the well.
    *   **Allowed Actions:** Reading books/articles, watching tutorials, listening to `Research Radio` backlog, visiting museums, gathering data.
    *   **Forbidden Actions:** Focusing on creating final outputs (painting, writing final drafts).

*   **Day 2: Output (Creation & Execution)**
    *   **Mission:** To make. Write, code, paint, design, shoot, ship. Empty the well.
    *   **Allowed Actions:** Working on projects, writing code, painting, editing photos/videos, executing tasks from the Master List.
    *   **Forbidden Actions:** Getting lost in new research, excessive planning.

*   **Day 3: Synthesis (Planning & Connection)**
    *   **Mission:** To think and organize. Review progress, plan the next cycle, connect ideas. Tidy the well.
    *   **Allowed Actions:** Reviewing the past week, updating the TMM-OS (especially Docs 09 & 13), journaling, brainstorming, sketching mind maps, light administrative tasks.
    *   **Forbidden Actions:** Starting major new execution tasks.

### 3.0 The Daily Focus Template (The "Rule of 3")
*(To be written at the start of each workday)*

**Date:** `[Enter Date]`
**Today's Rhythmic Directive:** `[Input / Output / Synthesis]`

**My Primary Focus This Week Is:** `[e.g., Finalizing the `Love Me Again` Dossier]`

**Today, I will align with my directive and advance my goals by accomplishing these 3 things:**
1.  **Goal 1 (Must Do):** `[e.g., (Output Day) - Write the 'Methodology' and 'Timeline' sections of the Dossier.]`
2.  **Goal 2 (Should Do):** `[e.g., (Output Day) - Edit 10 photos from the Vanz commercial shoot for my portfolio.]`
3.  **Goal 3 (Could Do):** `[e.g., (Output Day) - Spend 1 hour on the Deviare SQL module.]`

### 4.0 The Weekly Review Template
*(To be completed at the end of each week, e.g., on Sunday evening - a "Synthesis" activity)*

**Week of:** `[Enter Dates]`

1.  **Wins This Week:** What did I accomplish? What am I proud of?
    *   `[e.g., Finished the SQL module, Secured a meeting with a potential collaborator, Maintained my rhythmic cycle all week.]`

2.  **Challenges & Obstacles:** What got in the way? Where did I face friction?
    *   `[e.g., The commute was exhausting on Tuesday, I struggled with a specific Python library and lost 3 hours.]`

3.  **Key Learning:** What did I learn about my process, my energy, or my work?
    *   `[e.g., I learned that I am most productive on 'Output' days if I have done my 'Synthesis' planning properly. I also learned that I need to block out 'deep work' time in my calendar.]`

4.  **TMM-OS Update & Next Week's Focus:**
    *   **Update:** I have updated the `Master Task List` and the `Collaboration Matrix`.
    *   **Priority Focus for Next Week:** What is the single most important objective for the upcoming week? `[e.g., To complete and send the finalized 'Love Me Again' proposal to the NAC.]`

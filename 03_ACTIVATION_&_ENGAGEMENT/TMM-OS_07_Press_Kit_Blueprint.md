Charting a narrative from his origins in Seshego to his current base in Johannesburg, Masebe uses both analog and computational tools to investigate the unseen patterns that shape our lives. His work has been featured in campaigns for brands like Vans and Cotton On, while his personal projects interrogate themes of post-colonial legacy and digital identity.

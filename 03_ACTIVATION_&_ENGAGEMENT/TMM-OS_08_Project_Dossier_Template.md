*   A step-by-step description of how the project will be executed, from initial research and data gathering to final production and dissemination. This section demonstrates planning, feasibility, and your unique transdisciplinary approach.

**4.0 Key Deliverables & Outcomes (The "What")**
*   A clear, itemized list of the tangible outputs the project will produce (e.g., a series of artworks, an open-source dataset, a software tool, a public exhibition, a scholarly paper, a community workshop).

**5.0 Audience & Impact (The "Who Cares?")**
*   A description of the project's target audience and its intended impact.
    *   **Impact on Audience:** How will it affect those who experience it?
    *   **Impact on Field:** How will it contribute to art, data science, etc.?
    *   **Impact on Community:** How will it serve or reflect your local community?

**6.0 Project Timeline**
*   A realistic, phased timeline with key milestones and deadlines (e.g., Phase 1: Research, Phase 2: Production, etc.).

**7.0 Detailed Project Budget**
*   *(Paste the completed Project Budget Template from `Doc 06` here.)*

**8.0 Partnership & Sponsorship Tiers (The "Ask")**
*   A clear, tiered list of support opportunities for potential partners. Be specific about what you need and what you offer in return.

**9.0 Supporting Materials**
*   A list of attached or linked documents (e.g., Artist CV, Link to Press Kit, Portfolio of relevant past work).

### **Part 2: Populated Example - `The Biko Archives` Dossier**
*(This demonstrates how to use the template for a high-stakes, conceptual project.)*

---

**Project Title:** The Biko Archives: A Machine-Assisted Re-imagining
**Primary Brand:** `aes72studio` & `Masebe Data`
**Date:** 13 July 2025
**Prepared For:** A Major Arts & Technology Grant (e.g., The Ford Foundation, Art for Justice Fund)

**1.0 Project Summary**
"The Biko Archives" is a transdisciplinary research project that uses machine learning to critically engage with the visual and textual archive of Steve Biko. By training a StyleGAN (Generative Adversarial Network) on the complete visual record of Biko, the project will generate new, abstract "algorithmic ghosts"â€”textures and patterns that represent the machine's interpretation of this historical data. These outputs will be layered onto new photographic portraits to create a series of artworks that explore algorithmic bias, the politics of memory, and the act of re-animating a political archive through a contemporary technological lens.

**2.0 Conceptual Rationale**
This project is a direct application of my core mission to "explore the hidden patterns of the world through a fusion of artistic research and data science." It draws heavily on the archival investigation methodologies of **Carrie Mae Weems**, questioning not just what is in the archive, but how it is seen and interpreted. By introducing a non-human collaborator (the AI), we challenge our own perceptions and biases. The project engages with **Black Consciousness** by refusing to let Biko's image be a static historical artifact, instead treating it as a living dataset for new inquiry. It is an act of "embedded research" that positions me as a "participant observer" within the very data of our liberation history.

**3.0 Methodology & Process**
1.  **Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Curation (2 Months):** Collaborate with the Steve Biko Foundation and other archives to ethically source and digitize a comprehensive visual dataset. Meticulously clean and tag all images.
2.  **Phase 2: AI Model Training (3 Months):** Train a StyleGAN model on the curated dataset using cloud computing resources (AWS/Google Cloud). This is an iterative process of experimentation and parameter tuning.
3.  **Phase 3: Artistic Production (3 Months):** Create a new series of studio portraits. In post-production, composite the AI-generated textures with the new portraits, exploring different blending and layering techniques to create the final artworks.
4.  **Phase 4: Dissemination (2 Months):** Produce the final large-format prints. Write a critical essay on the process and its implications. Develop a public-facing web page to display the work and explain the technology.

**4.0 Key Deliverables & Outcomes**
1.  **The Art Series:** A series of 8-10 large-format, archival photographic prints.
2.  **The Open-Source Model:** The trained StyleGAN model, published on GitHub for other researchers and artists to use.
3.  **The Critical Essay:** A scholarly essay, "Algorithmic Ghosts," to be submitted to a leading art or technology journal.
4.  **The Digital Experience:** A web page showcasing the final artworks, with an interactive component allowing users to explore the AI-generated textures.

**5.0 Audience & Impact**
*   **Impact on Audience:** Will provoke critical dialogue on AI, history, and representation.
*   **Impact on Field:** Will pioneer a new, transdisciplinary methodology for engaging with historical archives and contribute to the global discourse on AI in art.
*   **Impact on Community:** Will offer a new way for younger generations to connect with the legacy of Steve Biko and the Black Consciousness movement.

**6.0 Project Timeline**
*   **Months 1-2:** Data Acquisition & Curation.
*   **Months 3-5:** AI Model Training & Experimentation.
*   **Months 6-8:** Artistic Production & Printing.
*   **Months 9-10:** Essay Writing & Digital Experience Build.

**7.0 Detailed Project Budget**
*(A full budget using the template from Doc 06 would be inserted here, detailing costs for cloud computing, photography production, printing, etc.)*

**8.0 Partnership & Sponsorship Tiers**
*   **Tier 1: Institutional Partner (Cash Funding: R 350,000):** Naming rights as primary partner, co-hosting of a launch event/symposium, inclusion of the works in a future exhibition.
*   **Tier 2: Technology Partner (In-Kind Sponsorship):**
    *   **Ask:** AWS/Google Cloud to provide compute credits for AI model training.
    *   **Offer:** Logo placement as "Official Technology Partner" on all materials; a detailed case study on using their platform for artistic research.
*   **Tier 3: Archival Partner (In-Kind):** The Steve Biko Foundation, providing access to archives in exchange for a full set of the final artworks for their own collection.

**9.0 Supporting Materials**

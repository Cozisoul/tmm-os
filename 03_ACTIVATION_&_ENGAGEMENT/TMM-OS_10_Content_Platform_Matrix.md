### 2.0 Platform Strategy Matrix

| Platform | Primary Role | Target Audience | Content Type & "What to Post" | Tone of Voice | Strategic Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Website (The Portal)** | **The Official Archive & Final Destination** | Curators, Funders, Gallerists, Serious Collaborators | - Polished, high-resolution portfolios of completed projects. <br> - Project "Dossiers" as detailed case studies. <br> - Long-form essays and critical writing. <br> - The downloadable Press Kit. | Professional, academic, authoritative, minimal. | **To Be the Definitive Source of Truth.** This is the link you put in every proposal. It must be flawless and instantly prove your professionalism and the depth of your work. |
| **LinkedIn** | **The Professional & Corporate Narrative** | Potential Employers, Corporate Collaborators, Funders, Recruiters | - Announcing career milestones (e.g., "Thrilled to begin my learnership at Ogilvy"). <br> - Sharing key insights from your data science studies (e.g., "A reflection on using Python for data cleaning"). <br> - Posting links to your completed project case studies from your website. <br> - Sharing well-researched articles about the intersection of art and technology. | Analytical, insightful, professional, forward-looking. | **To Build Legitimacy & Credibility.** This platform demonstrates your seriousness, your business acumen, and your position as an emerging thought leader in the art-tech space. |
| **Instagram** | **The Visual Diary & Community Hub** | Art Lovers, Gallerists, Fellow Artists, Potential Sponsors (e.g., Fuji), Design Community | - **Finished Work:** High-quality, "hero" shots of completed art. <br> - **Process:** In-studio shots, a sketchbook page, a screen with code, sanding a chair for `Love Me Again`. <br> - **Community:** Portraits and stories from community-based projects. <br> - **You:** Authentic posts showing you, the artist, grounding the practice. | Curious, poetic, visual, generous, authentic. | **To Showcase Your Aesthetic & Work Ethic.** This is where you build a visual following, connect with the art world on a personal level, and create the visual evidence that attracts brand sponsors. |
| **GitHub** | **The Technical Foundation & Open-Source Proof** | Technical Collaborators, Data Scientists, Creative Technologists | - Clean, well-documented code for your data visualization projects. <br> - Repositories for generative art experiments. <br> - Detailed `README.md` files that explain the "why" and "how" of each technical project, linking back to your main website portfolio. | Systematic, clear, documented, open. | **To Prove Your Technical Competency.** A potential tech collaborator or data-focused funder will check this. It must be organized and demonstrate rigorous, clean coding practices. |
| **Research Radio (Platform)**| **The Intellectual & Experimental Hub** | Academics, Researchers, Students, Niche Art/Sound/Film Enthusiasts | - Full audio and video episodes. <br> - Detailed show notes with links to sources, influences, and further reading. <br> - Short, compelling video or audio clips (1-2 mins) for promotion on other platforms. <br> - Transcripts of episodes for accessibility and searchability. | Inquisitive, experimental, intelligent, calm. | **To Establish Thought Leadership & Intellectual Depth.** This platform proves that your work is backed by deep research and critical thinking, attracting an academic and highly engaged audience. |

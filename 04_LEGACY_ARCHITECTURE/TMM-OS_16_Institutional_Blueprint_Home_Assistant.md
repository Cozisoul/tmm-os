### 1.0 Vision & Positioning

*   **Official Title:** The Thapelo Masebe Home Assistant AI
*   **Vision Statement:** To create a local, privacy-first Home Assistant AI that uses sensors and a direct connection to the TMM-OS database to automate, organize, and enhance daily living, creative practice, and personal well-being.
*   **Positioning Statement:** This is not a commercial product, but a lifelong personal project. It is the ultimate expression of the transdisciplinary practiceâ€”a system where art, data, and daily life are not just connected, but are part of a single, integrated, and responsive ecosystem.

### 2.0 Core Purpose & Philosophy

The purpose of this AI is to **reclaim mental energy spent on small decisions** in order to preserve focus for high-value creative, intellectual, and personal pursuits. It is designed to be a non-intrusive, supportive system that aligns the physical home environment with the digital and creative ecosystems defined in the TMM-OS.

*   **Privacy First:** All processing (voice, language models) will run locally on a home server (e.g., Mac Studio) to ensure absolute data privacy.
*   **Minimalist Interaction:** The AI's responses will be short, clear, and non-intrusive, providing information and executing tasks without creating distraction.
*   **Aesthetic Alignment:** All interfaces and outputs will adhere to the TMM brand identity (Helvetica, systematic layout, cosmic latte tones).

### 3.0 Key Functionalities (The "What")

| Category | Functionality | TMM-OS Database Integration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Environment Control** | Adjust lighting for creative work or photo shoots. Trigger ambient soundscapes for focus or sleep. | Reads user preferences (future table). |
| **Health & Routine** | Provide reminders for water, breaks, and supplements. Track fasting and sleep routines. | Reads/writes to the `health_logs` table. |
| **Task & Time Management**| Add tasks via voice/text. Check daily schedule. Integrate with project timelines. | Reads/writes to the `tasks` table. |
| **Content & Research** | Summarize or read aloud research PDFs and articles. Queue `Research Radio` episodes. | Reads/writes to the `content_queue` table. |
| **Shopping & Inventory**| Track basic pantry inventory and generate shopping lists based on meal plans. | Reads/writes to a future `inventory` table. |
| **Communication Helper**| Draft simple messages for check-ins or gallery follow-ups. Remind about planned calls. | Reads from the `contacts` and `opportunities` tables. |

### 4.0 Technical Architecture (The "How")

*   **Core Backbone:** Home Assistant (Open-Source) running on a local server.
*   **Local LLM:** Ollama running a LLaMA-based model for intent parsing and text generation.
*   **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Local Whisper or Nvidia Riva.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Local OpenVoice or Piper.
*   **Database:** Direct connection to the local `tmm_os_db` MySQL database.
*   **Interface:** A simple, web-based dashboard for visual feedback, styled according to the TMM brand guide.

### 5.0 Phased Development Roadmap

This is a long-term project to be developed iteratively.

*   **Phase 1 (The Foundation - Complete):** The TMM-OS GitHub repository and MySQL database schema have been created.
*   **Phase 2 (Core Automation - Next 6 Months):** Install and configure Home Assistant. Integrate basic smart plugs and lights. Create simple time-based automations (e.g., "turn on focus light at 9 AM").
*   **Phase 3 (AI Integration - Next 12 Months):** Set up Ollama and local STT/TTS services. Create the first simple voice commands that trigger Home Assistant automations.
*   **Phase 4 (Full TMM-OS Integration - Next 24 Months):** Develop the Python scripts to connect the AI to the `tmm_os_db`. The AI will graduate from triggering simple automations to reading and writing data from your personal database (e.g., "Add 'buy new paint' to my task list").

### 1.0 Vision & Positioning

*   **Official Title:** Studio Masebe
*   **Vision Statement:** To establish a world-class, transdisciplinary research office and production studio with its heart in **Seshego, Limpopo**, and strategic satellite offices in Johannesburg and Cape Town.
*   **Positioning Statement:** Studio Masebe is a decentralized creative institution architected for the 21st century. It is a professional research "office" for developing ideas and a production "studio" that leverages a network of specialized workshops for fabrication. Its primary mission is to create world-class work while investing directly in the cultural and economic ecosystem of the founder's home community.

### 2.0 The Hub-and-Spoke Model

The studio will operate on a hub-and-spoke model, designed for flexibility and strategic presence.

*   **The Hub: The Seshego "Factory" (Phase 3 Goal)**
    *   **Function:** The primary headquarters, creative engine, and community-facing institution. This will be the largest physical site, housing the core team, the primary archive, and public programming. It is the heart of the practice, symbolizing a "return home" and a long-term investment in the region.
*   **The Spokes: JHB & CPT Offices (Phase 2 Goal)**
    *   **Function:** Small, agile, professional office spaces in major creative capitals. These will not be large production studios but strategic meeting points for client engagement, networking, and project management. They serve as the commercial and collaborative gateways to the creative work being developed in the Seshego Hub.

### 3.0 Production Philosophy: The Grcic/Boyce Model

The studio will adopt a modern, flexible production model inspired by the practices of Konstantin Grcic and Martin Boyce.
*   **In-House:** The core team will focus on research, conceptual development, design, prototyping, and project managementâ€”the "thinking."
*   **External Collaboration:** For large-scale or specialized fabrication (e.g., complex metalwork, high-volume furniture production, large-format printing), the studio will partner with a curated network of the best workshops and fabricators in South Africa and internationally.
*   **Authorship:** Studio Masebe retains full creative authorship and direction, with all collaborators being properly credited as key parts of the production system, as is professional best practice.

### 4.0 The Seshego "Factory" - Architectural & Spatial Concept

*   **Inspirational DNA:** The Professionalism of the Office (Grcic) + The Energy of The Factory (Warhol) + The Integration of the Institute (Eliasson).
*   **Core Spaces & Functions:**
    *   **The Digital Lab:** The core of the building. A state-of-the-art hub for data analysis, AI training, and generative art development.
    *   **The Research Archive:** A physical and digital library housing the books, materials, and data that fuel the practice.
    *   **The Prototyping Workshop:** A smaller, in-house workshop for testing ideas, building models, and small-scale fabrication.
    *   **The Project Space:** A flexible gallery and public-facing space for exhibitions, workshops, and community events.
    *   **The Office:** A quiet, professional space for the administrative and project management functions.
    *   **The Kitchen:** The social heart of the studio, for hosting talks, dinners, and collaborations.
    *   **Residency Quarters:** A self-contained unit to host a visiting artist, researcher, or collaborator.

### 5.0 Strategic Phasing for Establishment

*   **Phase 1 (Years 5-8): JHB Office & Network Development.**
    *   **Goal:** Establish the first small, professional office "spoke" in Johannesburg.
    *   **Action:** Lease a small, well-located office space. Begin formally identifying and building relationships with the network of high-quality fabrication workshops.
*   **Phase 2 (Years 9-12): The Seshego Land Acquisition & Design.**
    *   **Goal:** Acquire a suitable plot of land in or near Seshego.
    *   **Action:** Begin high-level conversations with local authorities, potential patrons, and community stakeholders. Commission an architectural firm to design the "Factory." Launch the primary capital campaign.
*   **Phase 3 (Years 13-15+): Construction & Launch.**
    *   **Goal:** Construct, equip, and launch the Seshego Hub.
    *   **Action:** Complete construction. Hire a small core administrative and technical team. Launch the first year of public programming and the residency program. Establish the Cape Town "spoke" office.

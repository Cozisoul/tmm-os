### 1.0 Official Title & Positioning

*   **Official Title:** Studio Masebe â€” The Roodepoort "Factory"
*   **Positioning Statement:** A transdisciplinary research institute and production studio dedicated to exploring the intersection of art, data, community, and African identity. It is a 21st-century "factory" for producing not just objects, but ideas, collaborations, and new models for creative practice.

### 2.0 Mission & Guiding Principles

*   **Mission Statement:** To establish a world-class physical hub in Roodepoort that dissolves the boundaries between art, design, technology, and community. It will serve as the engine for Thapelo Masebe's practice and as a catalyst for the local and international creative ecosystem.
*   **Guiding Principles:**
    *   **Radical Openness:** To foster a culture of shared knowledge and transparent process.
    *   **Rigorous Experimentation:** To provide the tools and intellectual freedom for ambitious, category-defying projects.
    *   **Community Integration:** To be a resource *for* and a reflection *of* its local community, not an isolated institution.

### 3.0 Architectural & Spatial Concept

*   **Inspirational DNA:** The integrated research/production model of **Studio Olafur Eliasson** + the cultural/social energy of Andy Warhol's **The Factory**.
*   **Aesthetic:** Industrial Brutalism meets Minimalist Elegance. A repurposed light-industrial building is the ideal shell. Key materials are exposed concrete, raw steel, glass, and warm wood. The space must be highly flexible and modular.
*   **Core Spaces & Functions:**
    *   **The Workshop (The "Clean" Space):** A state-of-the-art fabrication lab for furniture making (`TMHH`), object restoration (`Love Me Again`), and sculptural work (`aes72studio`). Features CNC routers, 3D printers, and traditional woodworking tools.
    *   **The Digital Lab (The "Data" Space):** A climate-controlled server room and workstation hub for data analysis, AI model training, and generative art development.
    *   **The Art Studio (The "Wet" Space):** A private, well-ventilated studio for painting and other messy fine art practices. Excellent natural light is a prerequisite.
    *   **The Kitchen (The "Social" Space):** The heart of the studio. A large, communal kitchen and dining area designed to host talks, dinners, and informal collaborations.
    *   **The Archive (The "Memory" Space):** A physical library and material archive containing the books, objects, and research materials that fuel the practice. It also serves as a secure, climate-controlled storage for completed artworks.
    *   **The Project Space (The "Public" Space):** A flexible, double-volume gallery space to test-run installations, host exhibitions, and conduct public workshops.

### 4.0 Programming & Public Engagement Model

*   **Studio Practice:** The primary function is to house the day-to-day operations of all TMM brands.
*   **Residency Program:** A funded, three-month residency for one emerging artist, writer, or researcher per year whose work aligns with the studio's core principles. The resident will have access to all studio facilities and mentorship.
*   **Public Workshop Series:** A quarterly series of ticketed, hands-on workshops for the public (e.g., "Intro to Creative Coding," "The Art of Repair," "Data Visualization for Storytellers").
*   **"First Thursday" Open Studio:** The studio will open to the public on the first Thursday of every month, featuring work-in-progress, talks, and performances, integrating into the Johannesburg gallery circuit.

### 5.0 Strategic Vision for Establishment

*   **Phase 1 (2028-2033):** Site Identification & Patronage. Identify a suitable industrial property in Roodepoort. Begin high-level conversations with potential founding patrons and corporate partners based on the success of Phase 2 projects.
*   **Phase 2 (2034-2036):** Acquisition & Architectural Design. Secure property and commission an architectural firm to design the renovation and interior fit-out. Launch a capital campaign.
*   **Phase 3 (2037-2039):** Construction & Launch. Complete construction, hire a small administrative staff, and launch the first year of programming.
